	<h1>Start by talking about your audience, not yourself</h1>
	<p>Human nature dictates that we are, first and foremost, concerned with our own problems. While some of us may give to charity or volunteer in our spare time, when it comes to searching for products or services online, we're all about ourselves and what a brand can do for us.</p>
	<p>Blog Tyrant is a great example of a blog that is focused on its visitors. The first thing you see when you land on their about page is a video titled "About Me and You." The text that follows is then split into two sections, "About Me" and "About You (The Tyrant Troops)."I thought it would be great to share nine great, easily applicable techniques we picked up from some of our favorite About Us pages from around the web.</p>
